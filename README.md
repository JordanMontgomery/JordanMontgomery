## Hi, I'm Jordan Montgomery 👋

I'm a software engineer who has worked on a bit of everything over the years from enterprise software that had to run on several platforms(including z/OS mainframes!) to highly available SaaS apps deployed in public clouds. I've worked at big international corporations with 6 figure headcounts and small startups under 10 people. Some of my jobs have required wearing a number of hats so I've got a bit of experience with IT administration, DevOps, SecOps and compliance programs like SOC2 and FEDRAMP.

In my free time I like studying the history and monetary policy of the Roman Republic and other ancient societies. I spent a good bit of my adult life along the Colorado Front Range but recently have moved back to beautiful Central Kentucky where I spent my childhood.
