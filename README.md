## Hi, I'm Jordan Montgomery 👋

I'm a software engineer who has worked on a bit of everything over the years from enterprise software that had to run on 9 platforms including mainframes to highly available SaaS apps deployed in public clouds. I've worked at big international corporations with 6 figure headcounts and small startups under 10 people. In my free time I like studying the history and monetary policy of the Roman Republic. I spent a good bit of my adult life along the Colorado Front Range but recently have moved back to Central Kentucky where I spent my childhood.

- 💬 Ask me about Go, C++, writing multiplatform software or what happened to Roman coinage circa 212 BC
- 📫 You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-montgomery-54553651/) or by posting an issue to this repo
- 📝 I occasionally write papers on Roman Republic Numismatics which you can find on [Academia.edu](https://independent.academia.edu/JordanMontgomery4)
